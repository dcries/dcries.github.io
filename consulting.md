I am available for personalized consulting including everything from business needs to dissertation assistance. My experience at Sandia National Laboratories and at Iowa State University has led to productive relationships with mechanical, electrical, computer manufacturing, and transportation engineers, as well as chemists, biologists, and business people. 

My expertise can help frame questions, collect useful data in the most efficient way, and analyze data to make decisions that benefit your business. Email me to set up a free one hour consultation to discuss your goals.
